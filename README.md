#  Reservation 

This is a ** Reservation System ** built with **ASP.NET Core 9**, designed to handle room bookings efficiently and prevent duplicate or conflicting reservations.

The project uses **Vertical Slice Architecture** to achieve better separation of concerns and maintainability.  
To handle concurrency and avoid race conditions, it leverages **Redis** and **RedLock.net** for distributed locking.
