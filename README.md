#  Reservation 

This is a **Reservation System** built with **ASP.NET Core 9**, designed to handle room bookings efficiently and prevent duplicate or conflicting reservations.

The project uses **Vertical Slice Architecture** to achieve better separation of concerns and maintainability.  
To handle concurrency and avoid race conditions, it leverages **Redis** and **RedLock.net** for distributed locking to handle concurrency and prevent double booking scenario.  
It also implements the **Outbox Pattern** to ensure reliable and consistent delivery of notification messages to **RabbitMQ**, enabling eventual consistency in a distributed environment.

- Reliable message delivery using the **Outbox Pattern** with **RabbitMQ**  
- Fluent input validation using **FluentValidation**  
- Data persistence using **Entity Framework Core** with **SQL Server**  
- Clean, extensible structure for handling different reservation scenarios
